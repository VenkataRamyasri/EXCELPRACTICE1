Today’s Excel Practice- Worked with a student dataset containing various scores.
- Performed calculations:
    - Calculated Total Scores by adding all subject marks.
    - Computed averages (mean) of scores.
    - Found median and mode of marks.
    - Used COUNT, COUNTA, and COUNTBLANK:
        - COUNT: counts only numbers.
        - COUNTA: counts numbers + text (non-blank cells).
        - COUNTBLANK: counts empty cells.
    - Applied SUMPRODUCT to get totals after multiplying corresponding ranges.
- Conditional Logic:
    - Used IF to label students as Pass or Fail based on total marks.
    - Categorized students into First Division, Second Division, or No Division (Fail) using nested IF conditions.
- Conditional Formatting:
    - Highlighted all Fail students with a red background for easy identification.

Overall, practiced key Excel functions: aggregation (SUM, AVERAGE, MEDIAN, MODE), counting (COUNT, COUNTA, COUNTBLANK), logical tests (IF), and formatting for better data visualization.
